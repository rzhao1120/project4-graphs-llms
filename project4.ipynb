You\\\\u2019ve got three options for that\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFirst, you can take a bus. Peoria Charter is a good option because they have service to ORD from three stops in CU every two hours or so (and more on busy travel days like school breaks). It\\\\u2019ll take around 3.5-4 hours to get to ORD and tickets around $40-$50 each way\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nYou could also take the train, but it\\\\u2019s a bit more complicated, as Amtrak\\\\u2019s routes from Champaign to Chicago will end up you at Union Station in downtown. From there you\\\\u2019ll need to take the CTA blue line to the airport. It\\\\u2019s around a 2.5-3 hour train ride plus about 45 minutes on the CTA line. Amtrak tickets are much cheaper though, as they only cost around $15 if you book in advance (plus another $5 for the CTA ticket to the airport). You also have more limited timing options, as there are only 3 trains per day from Champaign to Chicago\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLastly, you could fly. There are two flights a day from Champaign to ORD, on American (but they\\\\u2019re operated by Envoy Air if that matters to you). Then you just take a connecting flight to EWR.

I\\'m so glad I have someone to relate to.. everyone just seems so set on their major and I feel so behind.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe thing with me and design is that I can imagine it, even with great detail, but I can\\'t put it to paper.

It sounds really interesting. Thanks for bringing it up\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnd construction? Love it! The course outline for Arch studies seems a lot more design-based than what they advertise, which is a bit sad. The only structural\\\\/technical courses you would take are during your Sophomore year. The two years after that? Design studios. Arch studies at UIUC used to be Arch Engineering.

All of which are pretty good!\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLegends is a fun Illini themed dive bar with decent food, and Kams is our most popular \\\\\"nightclub\\\\\" esk student bar. Murphys is also a pretty relaxed pub with decent food. Illini Inn is a more neighborhood bar vibe and is nestled in Greek row again with decent food. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhile I personally enjoy Lion, I would steer clear of it! \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDowntown Champaign is also filled with really high-quality restaurants and isn\\'t too far from campus town.\",\"243\":\"Tailgate. It\\'s college football. Students tend not to tailgate because its expensive as a student if your parents aren\\'t paying, but as adults with adult income, all of you chipping in some money to tailgate shouldn\\'t be much of an issue. In reality, it probably costs a similar amount of money to send bars vs tailgate, but students are much happier spending that money purely on booze than on a tailgating setup lol. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nParking is $25 day of (might be $20 if you prepay, but I\\'ve never done it so idk how it works). If you have multiple cars, I recommend finding a random university lot with meters a ways away from the stadium and parking any additional cars there (most metered university lots are free on weekends) and taking a bus back to the stadium for free. That way you only pay for the one car and can just pay $5 per guy for parking. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs far as places to go, Green Street is great for students, but options are more limited for adults (most adults don\\'t want to go to a club-esque college bar and eat drunk student food after a game lol). The best options tho are likely Legends and Murphy\\'s. They\\'re both bars with food, and bar wise, much closer to a true bar while places like Kams or Lion are trying imitate more of nightclub vibes. Off campus tends to be where most people go out of college, specifically going to downtown Champaign. This is where the majority of good local resteraunts are at. There\\'s a lot of good ones from Blackdog. Guidos, Esquire Lounge, etc. Plus I think 1-2 breweries are in there as well if you\\'re into that. Never been to them tho. If you want more sitdown chain types of places, they\\'re scattered throughout town, but mostly located on and around Prospect Ave, north of 74.

It\\'s unlikely that anyone would notice if you applied to one program, *got rejected*, and then applied for another, but in principle, that information is visible to the admissions committee and CS faculty who know where to look.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI\\'m not certain what would happen in if you were *accepted* for spring admission to MCS and then applied for MSCS admission in the fall, but **my best guess is that your MSCS application would be automatically rejected**.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nYou are definitely not allowed to apply to more than one CS graduate program *at the same time.*  If you did submit simultaneous MCS and MSCS applications,  your MSCS application would be automatically rejected, and possibly your MCS applciation as well.  Similarly, if you already have a master\\'s degree in CS or a nearby field, you can\\'t be admitted to another master\\'s degree program in CS.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBut like I said, I\\'m not certain whether your plan is allowed.  You really should ask someone in the [CS graduate advising office](https:\\\\/\\\\/siebelschool.illinois.edu\\\\/academics\\\\/graduate\\\\/graduate-forms-advising-resources\\\\/graduate-advising-contacts).  Don\\'t just take my pessimistic word for it!\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRegardless of what they tell you, my recommentation is that you decide which master\\'s degree you actually want, *and then apply only to that one*; don\\'t waste your time, or the admissions committee\\'s time, by applying to both.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n* If you want to do reserach, apply for MSCS (but remember that you won\\'t be admitted unless at least one professor declares that they\\'re willing to be your advisor).\\\\r\\\\n* If you don\\'t want to do research (or you can\\'t identify a likely advisor) then apply for MCS.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nEither way, you should simultaneously apply to similar programs at half a dozen other universities, so that all your eggs aren\\'t in one basket.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo answer your final question: Yes, applications to MCS and MSCS both require three recommendation letters, a statement of purpose, and a complete set of transcripts.  Admission to the MCS program is based primarily on grades, as long as you have a decent computer science background.  Admission to the MS program requires some evidence of research potential to be visible in your statement and your rec letters.\",\"900\":\"Everyone I know got an A+ last semester.\",\"901\":\"Is this a rick roll\",\"902\":\"It was not\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThis is good\",\"903\":\"Super cool!!\",\"904\":\"I know right?!\",\"905\":\"I cant dm but i have the 3rd edition.

Those boys also need to learn common courtesy and expectations of our society which includes allowing the accessible spaces to be used by people who need them.\",\"1194\":\"Now I\\\\u2019ll admit, I\\\\u2019m in a wheelchair so it is definitely different but i usually just say something along the lines of \\\\u201cHey, can we trade seats?

First, be precise about what you need.   Different seats may be \\\\\"accessible\\\\\" depending on the room and the nature of the disability or (e.g. children) difference.   \\\\\"I have trouble climbing stairs\\\\\" will work better.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSecond, talk to the instructor because they can help.    People do start to behave better if the instructor is heading towards them.  In one case, I put a \\\\\"reserved\\\\\" sign on a seat that someone needed for exams.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThird, show up early if possible.  This is particularly helpful at the start of term, when people don\\'t know one another and haven\\'t yet settled into a favorite seat.   \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFourth, as others have said, speak up.   Many people find this hard, but it\\'s an essential skill and it gets easier with practice.  Other students are often preoccupied and\\\\/or don\\'t know what you need.

Accessible seats are like accessible stalls---while they are accessible to those who are handicapped, they aren\\'t explicitly *reserved* for the disabled.

Being too \\\\\"self conscious\\\\\" to speak to people will get you nowhere in life; college is the time for you to learn speaking skills.

Imo should speak up once, if it happens again have the Prof or GSI give an announcement.

Mostly understandable to not want to have the burden of doing so. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDiff of course is that in a bathroom you have few stalls, but in a classroom there are many non-accessible seats to take and leave those available. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nVery happy OP made this PSA, could just be the introverted version of the above to deal with your classroom situation hopefully through the grape vine at least.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nETA: I was homeschooled and have social anxiety, and found practicing scripts or dialogue and thinking of myself from a third person perspective can help.

The bat wants to get outside and is flying around trying to find an exit. They can sense the outside air and will leave. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBats cannot fly for very long. They will land on a vertical surface like drapery or blinds. In both instances in my home they were brown bats and they clung to a dark brown fabric strip on the blinds. They can be very hard to spot. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMost likely the bat is still in your apartment unless there was an open door or window. They don\\\\u2019t seem very good at returning through the small entrances they used to get into the house. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nBats are dangerous because of rabies. You can contract rabies even through minor contact with a bat (a scratch is sufficient, doesn\\\\u2019t have to be a bite). Untreated rabies in humans is nearly always fatal. You may want to go to student health services just in case. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSo, this is a serious situation. You need to have someone come to your apartment and find the bat and how it got in. Even if you toss it out, it may try to regain access via the same method it originally entered (if the bats are nesting in an attic or crawl space adjacent to your apartment).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI would not let the landlord blow off the situation.\",\"1324\":\"We used to regularly get bats in our house in Champaign. It\\\\u2019s almost impossible to find out how they get in, and as other posters have noted, they are really bad at leaving. They often enter low down but will always fly up to a higher floor if they can, and will end up in the southwest room\\\\u2014in our house, the master bedroom. If you can find them the next morning, animal control will remove them, usually by grabbing them bare-handed and stuffing them into a bag for later release. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe chances of a bat having rabies is very, very low (especially compared to other animals), but not zero. We thought our son might have been bitten, went to the doc who said, \\\\u201cnope. Not a bat bite,\\\\u201d and that was that. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe looked into having our house bat-proofed. It was like $20,000 ten years ago, which seemed absurd.

Planning ahead can keep you from being drunk, alone, and lost at the same time.\",\"1365\":\"A wonderful story, but maintain vigilance as best you can.  If you are lost on campus or in the area, find somewhere well lit and an MDT sign or stop.  The bus service is a great go-to in a pinch, and can either give you directions or possibly take you partway there.  They run all day and night.  Be aware they only stop on the side of the street of the sign, so if you miss one on the other side, wait a few minutes and one will be rolling up to your side. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIf you\\\\u2019re on campus and near an open university office or admin building, those are also a halfway decent option, so long as you can find a faculty or staff member. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGambling on the kindness of random strangers, especially if you are a woman, is extremely risky sober, much less inebriated.  \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAs far as police in this scenario go, only approach marked and obvious vehicles or officers.  I say this because of what happened to Yingying Zhang, who was lost and running late before a guy claiming to be an off duty cop offered her a ride.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDon\\\\u2019t be afraid to call the campus police non-emergency number either:  (217) 333-1216\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nGoogle Maps app can tell you MDT bus schedules and estimates of arrival.  \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nUse your best judgment, and while 98% of folks in the C-U area are friendly and decent, that number is not 100.\",\"1366\":\"Big kudos to those guys!\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nJust to give more info on SafeRides as someone else mentioned, here\\'s the link to MTD\\'s website with a page specifically about SafeRides (if you don\\'t want to click a link you can find the page by searching \\\\\"UIUC SafeRide\\\\\" in your browser):\\\\u00a0https:\\\\/\\\\/mtd.org\\\\/maps-and-schedules\\\\/uiuc-learn-to-ride\\\\/saferides\\\\/\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSafeRides are available OVERNIGHT even during times when the standard bus routes aren\\'t active, and are available until 6am during the fall and spring semesters. **There is no charge, you just show your iCard.** There are some limitations, such as SafeRides not being available far outside of standard bus route limits and not being available to pick up someone directly from a bar, but essentially if you can get to a bus stop or 24-hour university building or something within the specifications listed on the web page, they will pick you up.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nUIUC also has SafeWalks available until 2:30am during the semester (search in your browser for \\\\\"UIUC SafeWalk\\\\\" if you don\\'t want to click this link:\\\\u00a0https:\\\\/\\\\/police.illinois.edu\\\\/services\\\\/safewalks\\\\/); again **there is no charge** for this either, they\\'ll send (I think 2, but I\\'m not sure) student patrol officers to walk with you to wherever you need to go. Student patrol officers aren\\'t police, although they can contact the police directly if something concerning or dangerous happens (i.e. if you\\'re being followed and threatened).\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt would also be good to memorize a couple of UIUC buildings that are open 24 hours a day, so if you need to get into a public space with people around quickly you have options. Grainger is usually open 24 hours a day on weekdays during regular semesters, you just need your iCard (I think your ID in the Illinois App would also be accepted) to enter the building after 10pm, and there\\'s Internet service and public computers there that you can use to contact someone to help you get home. Obviously it\\'s much less busy that late at night but there are still a few staff and faculty members around in case you really need immediate help and aren\\'t in a state to handle the situation alone.\",\"1367\":\"10 years ago a friend got jumped by a group when he was drunkenly stumbling home from Joes and he has facial nerve damage to this day.\",\"1368\":\"so so lucky.

You\\\\u2019ve set up a straw man version of my argument to then knock it down. The point of my original comment is that towing companies are not, in fact, driving around looking for cars to tow. They don\\\\u2019t have a list of what cars belong or not. They don\\\\u2019t make that call, and the threshold for making it is pretty high. The only instance in which a tow could be made from campus without the spot admin handling it is if it\\\\u2019s literally posing a hazard, ie blocking a fire lane or impeding traffic.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFurther, you experienced an edge case and it sucks. But the vast majority of campus tows occur when someone knowingly places their car in a spot it does not belong and leaves it there so long that it has to be removed to allow others to do their job. The tow company has to pay a professional to move the car without damaging it; they have to be legally responsible for it to ensure it isn\\\\u2019t damaged or stolen while in their possession; and they have to have the staff to make it available to the right person upon request. They aren\\\\u2019t charging a ton because they are rolling in cash. They are charging because cars are expensive to move and guarantee.\",\"1558\":\"No, this is not correct for campus spots. I have seen a parking rental agreement for campus and the spot where you list people who are authorized to call a row. No one else can call a tow for that spot.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nMy guess would be at Orchard Downs they have a nighttime contact who is responsible for monitoring the lot. The reason you saw many empty spots is because it\\\\u2019s someone\\\\u2019s job to keep the lot available for residents.

That\\\\u2019s just for the tow itself and these days probably on the low end. This isn\\\\u2019t some inflated fee. This is specialist labor that needs expensive equipment that must be purchased and maintained.

Even many years after that we have had several instances where they refuse to leave your property because whatever it is that they want you to sign is \\\\u201cquick and important and has to be done right then and there\\\\u201d which is all bullshit. Call the police if they refuse to leave your property\",\"1950\":\"Technically not a scam. Take their info and research them online yourself.

The counseling center\\\\u2019s purpose is to help students, but they can only accommodate a small amount of long term clients due to the size of the student body and the limited amount of counselors they have. They will do a certain number of sessions with you and then try to refer you out to somewhere else in the community. If you are looking to just try therapy short-term for a few sessions, or want help finding other mental health resources in town, it could definitely be useful. But if you are looking for something long term I would research other options. People expect a team of about 20 counselors to be a catch-all solution to the entire breadth of potential mental health issues of 50,000 students, but really they are a crisis management\\\\/referral service. If you are keeping all that in mind I think it\\\\u2019s worth trying out.

Things like chips, individually wrapped snacks,, cereal, etc are stupidly expensive right now.  The trade of in the cost of healthy\\\\/homemade food is that it can be time consuming to cook it.

If you\\'re looking to browse, it\\'s a little more challenging in a huge university library than at a bookstore or local library, but it can be done! The Main Stacks and the Literature and Languages Library are your best bets. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIn the Library of Congress system, works of British literature are catalogued as PR (followed by a bunch of numbers) and works of US literature are catalogued as PS (followed by a bunch of numbers). Within those categories, books are arranged by broad chronological order, so the smallest numbers are generally works of or pertaining to the earliest literary periods, and the larger numbers are the most recent. Within each time period, the books are arranged by author\\'s last name. If you go to the actual library and find a map with all the locations of the Library of Congress numbers, you can usually find the vast array of shelves that have books you\\'d want to read. It\\'s still going to be challenging because works of scholarship and analysis are mixed in with the fiction (e.g., you\\'ll find all the books written ABOUT Toni Morrison and her novels alongside Sula, Beloved, Song of Solomon, etc.), but once you figure the pattern out, it gets easier to skim the shelves.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nA simple strategy is to think of a book that you\\'ve already read or are curious about), look it up in the catalog to get the LC number for it, and then go to that section of the library, where you\\'ll find other books from the roughly the same period. (Particularly useful if you\\'re interested in novels from non-US\\\\/non-British authors, or if you want to explore memoirs, literary nonfiction, and the like). \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nHappy reading!\",\"2961\":\"Go into the main stacks and have a look around.  I take oit mystery novels along with other books from there.  I believe they also have fiction novels.  The college libraries such as grainger house major specific books.

They allow for people to find and make friends with others in the same situation. This ends up being great when large groups of people with the same end goal make a friend group and continue to help each other out. For example, the physics RSOs lean social, but all the people that show up find friends who will continue to work together in grad school applications, internship applications, etc.\",\"2977\":\"Gonna throw my hat into the ring here because this topic has always been interesting (and a bit frustrating, at the fault of nobody in particular) to me as a lead in both an engineering org targeted at women and an ACM SIG lead (obligatory disclaimer my opinions do not reflect my RSOs opinions, I\\\\u2019m speaking as an individual, etc). Women\\\\u2019s orgs (and orgs associated with industry minorities generally speaking, though I can only personally speak for women\\\\u2019s orgs) inherently have a harder job to do with less resources than the average engineering RSO, and I don\\\\u2019t necessarily think it\\\\u2019s fair to expect the same level of depth from them. Let me explain what I mean.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s say the average freshman CS major can join one professional RSO before going crazy. To simplify, we\\\\u2019re gonna say that freshman CS majors can pick between ACM and WCS. ACM is targeted at all genders but in practice is male dominated, and WCS is mostly targeted at women and gender minorities. Let\\\\u2019s say that there are 600 men and 300 women in the incoming freshman CS class. Nearly 100% of freshman men in CS will pick ACM because they don\\\\u2019t necessarily need to seek out their gender to find it in this industry. Let\\\\u2019s say 2\\\\/3 of freshman women in CS join WCS and 1\\\\/3 join ACM. There are now 700 freshman in ACM and 200 freshman in WCS. As someone who has seen the internals of how clubs get funding, I can tell you both from a sponsorship standpoint and how SODA allocates funds that more attendance means more leverage for financial support. WCS\\\\u2019s job is to do what ACM does with much less people and less funding and *also* to build a strong support system for women in the field while trying to retain a much higher percentage of people to stay afloat (which explains why you tend to see a lot more socials, office hours, etc). In my opinion, this is basically an impossible task. I don\\\\u2019t really have a good, streamlined solution to problems like this, I\\\\u2019ve spent a notable amount of my undergraduate career trying to find just that. That being said, in the meantime I\\\\u2019ve learned to get what I can reasonably expect to get out of women\\\\u2019s engineering RSOs, and looking back I wish I\\\\u2019d gotten more involved with them sooner. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI will also say as a final note that I can\\\\u2019t speak for your individual experience on this (or WECE as an org), but in terms of discourse or drama, the grass is not always greener on the other side. I love both my RSOs and generally have no issues with them but the closer you get to the top of clubs like this, the more hard directional choices you have to make, the more you see go down, the more time you see wasted on stuff that doesn\\\\u2019t matter, etc. Regardless of the breadth of shenanigans I\\\\u2019ve seen over time, I wouldn\\\\u2019t trade the effort I\\\\u2019ve put into either of them for the world.\",\"2978\":\"If you want to join a women-focused RSO to learn more skills, join SWE or AOE (i can\\\\u2019t speak for AOE other than the women who I knew who joined it are awesome but SWE is very social but also has things like mock interviews, resume reviews, etc). I joined WECE specifically to meet my fellow women in ece because there were so few of us\\\\ud83d\\\\ude22I don\\\\u2019t think there\\\\u2019s anything wrong with WECE being more social focused - from what I saw, that\\\\u2019s why many people joined, so it makes sense to have a focus on social events.

The 1967 BORDERS.\",\"3330\":\"How so \\\\ud83d\\\\ude10\",\"3331\":\"Part of the whole point of divestment is disclosure. You are bringing up very valid questions. We are aware that these partnerships exist, however we need to know to what capacity these exist. And I am sure, pro-Palestinian or not, it is important for you to know where your money is going and what it is going towards. The administration\\'s hesitance and reluctance to share this information with us leads us to believe the investments are directly going against the cause and towards military operations in Israel. We are asking for complete transparency because as students spending thousands of dollars going to this institution, that should not even be something that requires this much deliberation. Some partnerships are and could be weaker links, which is why we ask, what is the point of the partnership in the first place? Can we agree on alternatives, other corporations that can use our money in a much better light? All in all, throwing our hands in the air is really not the solution. It is precisely why we are where we are.\",\"3332\":\"No they havent. Hence why things have continued. And no, giving up is not an option. As we have displayed in history, violence is not an answer. So we are left with the only tool we have. Our voice and divestment. Truly the only thing that runs this world is money. Using that understanding is the only way forward. This is not a unique position by the way, there are many who argue the same point.\",\"3333\":\"Well I doubt many people on campus are actually asking uiuc to divest from McDonald\\'s and Starbucks.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSodastream is on the list because it has helped the Israeli government displace bedouins and discriminates against Palestinian employees, you would know this if you actually read the link.\",\"3334\":\"So you\\\\u2019re saying Hamas merely wanted Israel to forfeit its land gains from the 6 Day War? Let\\\\u2019s go with that for a second. Israel has tried to give the land back, Gaza back to Egypt, West Bank back to Jordan. These countries don\\\\u2019t want the Palestinians back, because the Palestinians are a terrible radical people who only cause trouble for Arab nations they integrate into lol.\",\"3335\":\"What kind of connection is acceptable? What connection is unacceptable?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe fact that you had a partnership with an Israeli university makes me suspicious\",\"3336\":\"Thank you for a wonderful rational explanation of your  take on this.\",\"3337\":\"\\\\u201cWe\\\\u2019re boycotting these companies for enabling and supporting genocide\\\\u201d\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOh no what did they do?\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\u201cThey tried to build a factory in the West Bank to employ Palestinians. Also that one gave out free happy meals!\\\\u201d\",\"3338\":\"What are you talking about? Gaza and the West Bank belong to Palestine and the Palestinian people.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAnd have you spoke to a single Middle Eastern person in your entire life? Let alone a Syrian or a Jordanian? We love our Palestinian friends and neighbors. You\\\\u2019re a racist loser\",\"3339\":\"Connections with corporations who fund the military operations against Palestinians is unacceptable. You might say, well, all corporations support Israel directly or indirectly in their military operations. Fine. Let\\'s take the example of Caterpillar. If Caterpillar does 5 things that are not related to supplying weapons to Israel, there is no harm in sending money for those 5 things. But there needs to be a contractual agreement that the institution will only fund those 5 things. The 6th, providing weapons to Israel, will be unacceptable. I understand that in this day and age, it is difficult to completely divest from corporations that supply other countries, regardless of if you agree with their policies or not. It isn\\'t impossible though. And sending money to corporations blindly without specifically allocating it to acceptable causes (such as internships and non-war related causes) is unacceptable.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAlso in regard to the partnerships with Israeli university, the university will pay taxes of course, money from which will go towards IDF and weapon manufacturing.\",\"3340\":\"Sodastreams factory provided livelihoods to internationally recognized illegal settlers, who help ethnically cleanse Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territories. This factory was shut down, and a new one was created on top of stolen bedouin land. The issue here is not BDS taking jobs away, it is the Israeli occupation and settlement that prevent Palestinians from controlling their own land.\",\"3341\":\"There has never been an independent state of Palestine in history. The Gaza Strip was taken from Egypt in the 6 Day War, the West Bank from Jordan. When Israel returned occupied land to these nations in the 80s, they refused to take control over these areas. Egypt had been the victim to several terrorist attacks by Palestinian radicals, and Jordan was already fighting its ethnically Palestinian population in order to ensure the continued rule of the Hashemite Dynasty. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nYour vibes have little to do with the reality of international politics.\",\"3342\":\"Ha! Didn\\\\u2019t have to even guess once that you\\\\u2019d be pro palestine too. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhen you have wars, and lose wars, you lose territory.

No way someone actually thinks like this.\",\"3347\":\"This is extremely weird behavior. You\\\\u2019re almost a father and you\\\\u2019re harassing a 19 year old for wanting him and his loved ones to be safe. Grow up man. Deeply embarrassing.\",\"3348\":\"Lol. I am not sure if you are aware, this is a nation-wide movement. Meaning universities across the United States as well as the globe for that matter, partake in investments with corporations whose involvement with Israel directly affects the lives of Palestinians. Also, would it make more sense for me to change the way things operate in order to stop or at least lessen the atrocities on my own people or just stop my education altogether? I hope you learned a thing or two from this conversation. And thank you for taking the time to ask the questions that were concerning to you. If this is a topic that you are genuinely curious about and would like to learn more in good faith, I have a ton of resources. Please don\\'t hesitate to send me a message.\",\"3349\":\"Taking civilians hostage is bad. I\\'m not familiar with the specific Israeli operation ur talking about but if it\\'s anything like their usual operations then they probably killed a lot of innocent civilians, which is worse than taking hostages in the first place.\",\"3350\":\"You can be as incredulous as you want, that doesn\\\\u2019t change the facts of the topic. The Middle East is moving past Palestine, the theory that there can be no peace without a Palestinian state is incorrect. Even Iran doesn\\\\u2019t care about Palestine, Hamas just presents a lucrative outlet for destabilization efforts that are far larger than the Palestinian plight. Palestine stands alone, and if they were smart they\\\\u2019d shake off their fundamentalist masters and surrender while the international still pities them.\",\"3351\":\"Here\\\\u2019s the problem with your argument:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nYou are a customer.

Do business with them. Problem solved.\",\"3352\":\"See I really don\\\\u2019t understand this bothsidism world view you advocate for. Under your framework for the world, taking a civilian hostage is bad, but taking them back is worse unless somehow you do it causality free, something that\\\\u2019s hard to do when the hostage is surrounded by armed militants and their families\\\\/human shields. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe right and moral answer is that when someone takes a hostage, no price is too great to take them back.\",\"3353\":\"You must have been a hoot back in the 60s when they protested Vietnam.

I guess since Hamas used these hostages as leverage to get Palestinian hostages released from Israeli custody that makes it all ok.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThanks for this fresh perspective, it\\'s changing the way I\\'m thinking about Hamas.\",\"3355\":\"I was a little kid during that era.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhat do you mean how is that looked at?\",\"3356\":\"I knew you were going to go here\\\\u2026\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nNo, Israeli prisoners arrested for trying to stab police officers or blow up car bombs are not in fact hostages, and Oct 7 was not a plot to free them.

I went to a different college and didn\\\\u2019t know a single person.  Developed a few friendships that are still intact almost 30 years later.  See someone sitting alone in the dining hall, ask if you can join them.  Start off with the where are you from, what\\\\u2019s your major, do you have any hobbies.  You just never know.

I got up at 3 am to cry in the restroom because I was so depressed but I didn\\\\u2019t want my roommate to know. I was such an idiot. If I told my roommate about this, she would help me. That\\\\u2019s the point here: UIUC is super supportive, and most people are incredibly nice. There are numerous activities aiming to help you fit into the community. It\\\\u2019s fine to be shy. I\\\\u2019m pretty sure there are lots of shy people, and most of them end up having life long friends in UIUC. You got this!\",\"4113\":\"I had quite bad social anxiety as a teen and struggled to make friends most of my life, being a total loner until I was 20. (Not that it\\'s easy now, but it\\'s not as impossible-seeming.) I would recommend trying to do at least one social thing a week (or every two weeks, do what is most manageable to you) that is slightly outside of your comfort zone, such as greeting a classmate\\\\/hallmate\\\\/random person, or attending a campus event. This is essentially exposure therapy and it\\'ll slowly make it less intimidating to socialize with strangers. Making friends is just about impossible if you never initiate interactions (though some of my favorite friends were more extroverted people who did approach me first). This way, you can put yourself out there more and increase your chances of meeting someone you\\'re socially compatible with. It doesn\\'t guarantee friends, and I know it\\'s exhausting to socialize with random people and not \\\\\"get\\\\\" anything meaningful out of it like a friend, but it\\'s what\\'ll make it easier to make friends. Also, here\\'s a tip, [a study](https:\\\\/\\\\/www.apa.org\\\\/news\\\\/press\\\\/releases\\\\/2021\\\\/09\\\\/deep-conversations-strangers) published through the American Psychological Association found that, \\\\\"People overestimate awkwardness, underestimate enjoyment of deep, meaningful conversations\\\\\" (just bring up deep conversation topics with people, the majority of the time both you and the other person will enjoy it way more than you expected).\",\"4114\":\"One crazy simple trick to meeting people is leaving your dorm door open while you\\\\u2019re hanging out in there. Social people from the hall will just start stopping in to talk. Next thing you know you have hall friends.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nRemoves the social anxiety for me because if they don\\\\u2019t want to talk, they can keep walking.

I was (and still am a bit) pretty introverted and tried small talk during welcome week and classes during my first semester and didn\\\\u2019t really make friends outside of class. My roommate was pretty much my own friend my freshman year. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nSophomore year came around and I ended up making some of my best friends that I hangout with to this day in my classes and labs after chatting with them and asking to study outside of class. Having to meet so many new people is still very tiring and anxiety inducing but it will pay off once you find the people that made it worth it.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nJust don\\\\u2019t give up on making friends, it\\\\u2019s ok to feel left out right now but you have some amazing years ahead of you here with people you haven\\\\u2019t met yet.

Some people get lucky and find their lasting friend groups immediately; many don\\\\u2019t. Lots of connections form under the pressure to be part of a group and then fall apart as people start finding more meaningful friendships. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nFocus on the people who seem interesting to you, whether or not they\\\\u2019re already part of a group. If already having friends makes them exclude you, then you\\\\u2019re better off without them.

You\\\\u2019ll always see people who don\\\\u2019t already have someone to talk to.

In general, people are a lot more open because there are so many people in your exact situation - a new environment and the fear of not making friends.
